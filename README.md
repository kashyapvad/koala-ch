Koala Sales Assistance Tool
Production Link: https://koala-web-ui-ch.netlify.app/

Overview
This project features a React frontend with a Rails backend, designed to help sales representatives craft AI-powered responses to common customer questions and objections.

Design Decisions
Backend Framework Focus: Emphasized building a robust backend framework to simplify the addition of CRUD resources with minimal code changes.

Use of JBuilder: Implemented JBuilder files as views to facilitate seamless communication between the Rails backend and the React frontend.

Frontend Structure: Established a resource store in the frontend to manage all necessary data, allowing for easy expansion as more resources are added.

Simplified Error Handling: Opted to spend less time on error handling to concentrate on creating a straightforward framework, reducing technical debt as the application scales.
